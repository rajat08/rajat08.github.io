Hello there ! My name is Rajat & I am currently an ML solutions engineer at <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/" target="_blank">Pinecone</a>, where we are trying to build a vector database for ML. 

Apart from ML (& tech) I love reading about anthropology and history. I'm a big soccer fan and have been a die hard Liverpool fan since I was a kid. I play a lot of video games mostly RPGs. Despite my indoor hobbies, I do try to step out as much as possible, workout as often as I can, lie on the grass every once in a while and play some soccer.
